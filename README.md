# openGL_playground
OpenGL Playground is just a short & small project for me to learn more about openGL, as many of the core concept of Vulkan is based on or inspired
by the concepts from OpenGL. 

# How to build
As this was just a playground, I did not use any of the fancy build systems. So to test this, you can just use the Visual Studio project file.

# Features
- Phong & Blinn lighting
- Shader modification without closing
- Vertex & face normal generation
- Custom texture mapping
- GUI to switch between different shaders/lights/textures

# Samples
